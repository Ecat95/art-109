  <summary>Artist Statement</summary>
  <p> The artwork is on roadless rules and how it helps.  The trump government wants to repeal its protections it and many other legal rulings give to the wilderness of the country. The impact is major with just in “California, about 21% of its 21 million acres of national forest — 4.4 million acres — are considered roadless” quote from Rachel Becker from the website Calmatters.  This is just in California which is third in the most effected state if this repeal ends up happening. Best case It paused just like the sale of national park land in a was able to be stopped from happening in the summer of 2025.
 The work is interactive images that are linked to other images and has a focus on three of California’s national forests that would be affected by the repel. The national forests talked about are Inyo, Los Padres, and Angles. They have a range of environments from coastal to snowy mountains. 
The interactively in the work shows the side effects that would happen more wildfires, water pollution, logging and as is said in the title of the ruling roads. Using animation to have movement and transparently to the side effects pages image. 
The main page uses Ascii art to show a basic map of California with the three national forests talked about. The Ascii art is interesting to use with a need to practice if done without any programs beyond a text doc. I find Ascii to be a primarily internet art with the use on webpages and documents.
