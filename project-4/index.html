<h1>Online</h1>

  <p> The internet of the future inspires many ideas. A hundred years from now when getting ready to go online you brush your teeth and change into your pajamas. As you laydown you grip the cord. The cord that connects to your plug that is on the back of your neck meeting your spine to your skull. It is as easy as putting on earrings just slide it in and off you go into the internet. </p>
 <p>
Emerging from the real world you have a menu space appear around you are telling you your options. Your chosen world of purple and blues is around you as the menu is poked and waved at. The goal of today is to study how to fly a plane with the tools needed to do so in the waking world. The homework is due in a week so better to start early to get a solid start. You drift the shortcuts to quick move locations as; you get to heading to the final short cut that leads to your hanger. As you are about to get to the last short cut you get a pop up saying that your friend wants to play a session of the latest game on the hub world Victar. Thinking of homework as always for later starts you sighing as you change direction. As you move toward Victar you ponder the latest in gaming was it a racing, detective or a taming game that they wanted to play. 
</p>  
<p>
Arriving after a moment of drifting though the shortcuts linking you to Victar you find your friend shifting the tool in their hand from a magnifying glass to a grappling hook as they pondered. Ah you mummer that game it had slipped your mind that the day had come for that game to come out. Victar apparently just got released a game Gala at the World’s Edge where you are a detective and have to parkour. Humming you remember that you thought the masked figures would up the challenge in the posts seen on the game. Your friend had been wanting to dress up as a plague masked figure which was one of the many masks or so-called rolls of the game. The idea of poison used in the game was a new concept letting the victim feel real effects from it. Of course, it wouldn’t be anything to major as then they would have to deal with that overprotective oversight group WORRY. The group WORRY already frets about the idea of the long-term effects of the internet plug on the human body. There is no need for the creator to want to deal with being bothered by it being to realistic or even nausea inducing. So, you are not to worried as you poke the back of your friend startling them into dropping the grappling hook. The game just came out so it is better to find a lobby spot soon before you have to wait for the next rounds.
</p>
<p>
As your friend finds the lobby with an eye to see if anyone you two know are also on a grouping to play the game. You see a surprising lack of returning players from previous sessions of the game on the lobby.
