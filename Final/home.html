<p>
The work is playing with what is dangerous for a small creature such as a cat in the modern world. The 3D figures are made in blender with a simple feel. The controllable land of the project that holds everything and lets the viewer move is A-Frame. The A-Frame lets everything be laid out for the viewer to look around. The viewer can go left or right from the starting point and see a few of the outdoor dangers in a space. The Cat is known for their curiously for a reason which can lead them to trouble.
